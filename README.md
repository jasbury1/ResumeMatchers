## How to work the program:

Start by installing any dependencies with the following command:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

All graph data files come pre-created. The run script run.sh will create a
fresh copy of the graph by running any setup steps over again. This may be
desireable to fetch new skills from recent job postings. This step is not
necessary for the application to function

**NOTE: if you are contrinbuting to this project, make sure to add all dependencies to *requirements.txt*.**
